00:00.000 --> 00:02.980
So I think we're going to live in a world where there are going to be hundreds of millions

00:02.980 --> 00:07.800
of billions of different AI agents, eventually probably more AI agents than there are people

00:07.800 --> 00:08.800
in the world.

00:08.800 --> 00:13.440
From generative AI to what's known as agentic AIs.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.960
That agent force is what he's calling it.

00:15.960 --> 00:16.960
Agent force will be...

00:16.960 --> 00:22.600
AI agents has become the talk of the town and today I'm going to explain this concept

00:22.600 --> 00:26.600
in a way that even a high school student can understand it easily.

00:26.600 --> 00:30.600
Let's start with analogy and then we will go into technical details.

00:30.600 --> 00:35.040
Let's say you have a restaurant you hire two waiters, Mohan and Madhu.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.600
Mohan is intelligent and accurate.

00:36.600 --> 00:41.640
He will go to a customer who is coming to a restaurant and then he will offer the food

00:41.640 --> 00:42.640
menu.

00:42.640 --> 00:44.680
The customer will order few things.

00:44.680 --> 00:49.000
He will accurately note it down and deliver it in a nice manner.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.200
While Mohan is accurate in his work, he doesn't provide extra suggestions or recommendation.

00:55.200 --> 01:01.040
Madhu on the other hand is also intelligent and accurate, but he provides extra suggestions.

01:01.040 --> 01:06.440
For example, if a customer is ordering naan and Indian curry and if the weather is cold

01:06.440 --> 01:11.840
outside, a Madhu will say, why don't you order this hot tomato soup?

01:11.840 --> 01:15.240
The weather is cold outside and it will really go well with this dish.

01:15.240 --> 01:20.680
If the customer is coming again and again, Madhu will recognize their favorite dish and

01:20.680 --> 01:25.200
they will say, oh, last time you order Hara Bara Kebab, would you like to repeat that?

01:25.200 --> 01:28.640
So this way Madhu is going one step ahead.

01:28.640 --> 01:30.800
He's an independent thinker.

01:30.800 --> 01:35.720
He's providing these suggestions and he's autonomous in the way that he works.

01:35.720 --> 01:40.000
The first waiter Mohan on the other hand is not autonomous.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.960
He will do things as directed.

01:41.960 --> 01:47.360
In this analogy, the second waiter Madhu is an AI agent.

01:47.360 --> 01:51.760
The first waiter Mohan is a traditional AI system.

01:51.760 --> 01:52.760
Okay.

01:52.760 --> 01:54.380
So both are AI system.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.620
The first one is a traditional AI system.

01:56.620 --> 02:00.820
The second one is an AI system, which is based on AI agent.

02:00.820 --> 02:05.760
Here I have the example of a regular chat board where you ask questions such as what

02:05.760 --> 02:07.500
are your store hours?

02:07.500 --> 02:09.620
What pizza options do you have?

02:09.620 --> 02:11.480
You can also place an order.

02:11.480 --> 02:16.880
This kind of chat board can be easily built using frameworks such as dialog flow, Rasa.

02:16.880 --> 02:22.420
There are LLM based frameworks to AI agent based chat board system.

02:22.420 --> 02:27.820
On the other hand, will be autonomous in certain decision making.

02:27.820 --> 02:33.800
For example, you're visiting this pizza store Pandeji pizza store every Friday evening and

02:33.800 --> 02:38.600
you're ordering same large veggie pizza with olive topping.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.740
This chat board can learn from it.

02:40.740 --> 02:44.700
And when you say I want to place an order, it can look at your history and say, Hey,

02:44.700 --> 02:48.740
would you like to reorder your usual large pizza?

02:48.740 --> 02:49.980
You'll say yes.

02:49.980 --> 02:52.480
It will also have awareness about environment.

02:52.480 --> 02:55.140
So here it is saying, Hey, it's cold out there.

02:55.140 --> 02:58.000
Do you want to add hot chocolate?

02:58.000 --> 03:04.980
So all these suggestions that it is providing, they are not coded into your Python program.

03:04.980 --> 03:08.980
This is something that this agent is coming up on its own.

03:08.980 --> 03:13.600
It can also check weather and traffic condition and say, Hey, you want to order a pizza, but

03:13.600 --> 03:17.860
there is a snowstorm and deliveries might be delayed.

03:17.860 --> 03:18.860
This is like human.

03:18.860 --> 03:23.740
If there is a human, he will be aware about environment weather, all of that, and they

03:23.740 --> 03:26.160
will provide extra suggestions.

03:26.160 --> 03:32.260
Now let's understand a little more in technical details, how regular AI chat board works.

03:32.260 --> 03:37.460
Whenever you are asking any question, it will first identify an intent.

03:37.460 --> 03:42.340
So let's say in my chat board, I have three type of intent, general inquiry, placing order

03:42.340 --> 03:43.340
refund.

03:43.340 --> 03:49.880
Based on the question, it will say, Hey, this is a general inquiry intent.

03:49.880 --> 03:54.520
Now you will be like, okay, you can just do exit sentence matching.

03:54.520 --> 03:59.580
And you can say, this is a software program varies AI, but this is an AI based system

03:59.580 --> 04:03.900
because your question might be different instead of saying, what are your store hours?

04:03.900 --> 04:06.760
You can say, Hey, can you tell me when the store is open?

04:06.760 --> 04:08.860
So there is no exit word to word matching.

04:08.860 --> 04:11.980
These two sentences are different, but the meaning is same.

04:11.980 --> 04:18.940
So if you're using any LLM, such as GPT, or cloud, etc, it will be able to match all

04:18.940 --> 04:20.600
these sentences, okay?

04:20.600 --> 04:25.660
You can just say that, hey, LLM, if someone asks questions, which is what are your store

04:25.660 --> 04:32.300
hours, or a similar question in English language, then the intent is general inquiry.

04:32.300 --> 04:38.700
Once you tell that to LLM, next time, if a person asks questions differently, then also

04:38.700 --> 04:41.300
it will be able to match that intent.

04:41.300 --> 04:46.120
A second question you can ask is, can you place an order with large veggie pizza or

04:46.120 --> 04:51.480
leaven spinach topping, it will match the intent, say place order, not only that it

04:51.480 --> 04:57.100
will extract the meaningful information, which is what is my order size, my type toppings,

04:57.100 --> 04:58.100
etc.

04:58.100 --> 05:03.540
And it will call an appropriate code or API or let's say Python function, which you can

05:03.540 --> 05:07.880
run and place the order and insert a record in database and so on.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.920
So this is a traditional chatbot.

05:09.920 --> 05:12.300
This doesn't use any agent, etc.

05:12.300 --> 05:17.240
If you want to learn more in detail, I have this free YouTube video where I build the

05:17.240 --> 05:21.000
exact same chatbot using dialog flow framework.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.880
Now let's see how AI agent chatbot will work.

05:23.880 --> 05:30.480
So first of all, AI agent chatbot will have exact same capabilities as the regular chatbot.

05:30.480 --> 05:33.840
But in addition, it will have extra capabilities.

05:33.840 --> 05:37.920
So when you give a sentence, it will be able to identify the intent, it will extract the

05:37.920 --> 05:41.800
information, call the Python function API and so on.

05:41.800 --> 05:47.080
But in addition, it will have access to something called tools.

05:47.080 --> 05:51.120
Now when I say tools, let's say weather API is one type of tool.

05:51.120 --> 05:57.040
So it will go check weather API and say there is a snowstorm and you know, there is a traffic

05:57.040 --> 06:00.280
deliveries are delayed, then it will give you this kind of response.

06:00.280 --> 06:05.240
It will say, hey, due to snowstorm deliveries might be delayed.

06:05.240 --> 06:09.600
It may have access to another tool such as a database.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.680
Database contains all the past records from the same customer.

06:12.680 --> 06:18.000
Now you can figure out that this customer is ordering same pizza every Friday at 7 p.m.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.120
or evening.

06:19.120 --> 06:23.000
Then you will say, hey, would you like to reorder your usual large pizza with olive

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
toppings?

06:24.000 --> 06:27.840
So see, this is intelligent and autonomous in your code.

06:27.840 --> 06:33.800
You're not return that when person says place an order, you should give this as a response.

06:33.800 --> 06:39.320
OK, in your code, you have not written that, but the agent figures this thing out on his

06:39.320 --> 06:42.020
own and provides suggestion.

06:42.020 --> 06:44.540
It can have access to web search.

06:44.540 --> 06:47.360
It can have access to a variety of APIs.

06:47.360 --> 06:53.800
So these tools are something that you can define when you are writing code for agent.

06:53.800 --> 06:59.920
So agent solution is something for which you have to write code, obviously, but you don't

06:59.920 --> 07:05.220
type all this instruction that if person places an order in a person has a same history

07:05.220 --> 07:08.600
Friday 7 p.m. large veggie, then just repeat that.

07:08.600 --> 07:11.600
OK, you are just providing all these tools, everything.

07:11.600 --> 07:16.960
And this suggestion is something that this agent comes up on its own.

07:16.960 --> 07:22.700
I give an example of an AI chat board, but there are a variety of solutions that can

07:22.700 --> 07:26.440
be a recommendation engine that can be a document search.

07:26.440 --> 07:29.720
You know, you can build a variety of solutions.

07:29.720 --> 07:34.500
Chat board is just one category of AI solutions to summarize.

07:34.500 --> 07:39.880
The main thing in AI agent is autonomy, independent thinking.

07:39.880 --> 07:43.580
Obviously, there will be some limitations on autonomy.

07:43.580 --> 07:47.880
Your chat board cannot say, hey, I will place your order for free and your family and friends.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.720
I will give everything for free.

07:49.720 --> 07:53.160
That kind of autonomy you can't give to the agents.

07:53.160 --> 07:58.520
So when you are building agents by writing code, you will have some kind of control over

07:58.520 --> 07:59.520
it.

07:59.520 --> 08:03.860
If you cannot control the AI agent will be autonomous.

08:03.860 --> 08:06.680
It's like your dog and you have a lease, right?

08:06.680 --> 08:09.840
So dog can roam around, but you have a lease.

08:09.840 --> 08:13.580
So the area where it can go, that area is limited, right?

08:13.580 --> 08:19.840
Let's say you have a two meter long lease or the string, you know, that you tie at dog's

08:19.840 --> 08:20.840
neck.

08:20.840 --> 08:23.140
The dog can roam around in that two meter radius.

08:23.140 --> 08:24.340
So it is autonomous.

08:24.340 --> 08:28.400
But on top of that, there is some control that you're imposing.

08:28.400 --> 08:34.720
There are frameworks such as Langraph, Microsoft autogen, crew AI, etc, that you can use to

08:34.720 --> 08:36.340
build AI agents.

08:36.340 --> 08:40.200
I'm going to be publishing more videos on AI agents in the coming time.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.160
So please keep an eye.

08:42.160 --> 08:45.800
And if you like this video, then please give it a thumbs up, share it with your friends.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.400
