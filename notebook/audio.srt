1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,980
So I think we're going to live in a world where there are going to be hundreds of millions

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:07,800
of billions of different AI agents, eventually probably more AI agents than there are people

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,800
in the world.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,440
From generative AI to what's known as agentic AIs.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,960
That agent force is what he's calling it.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,960
Agent force will be...

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,600
AI agents has become the talk of the town and today I'm going to explain this concept

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,600
in a way that even a high school student can understand it easily.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,600
Let's start with analogy and then we will go into technical details.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,040
Let's say you have a restaurant you hire two waiters, Mohan and Madhu.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,600
Mohan is intelligent and accurate.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,640
He will go to a customer who is coming to a restaurant and then he will offer the food

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,640
menu.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,680
The customer will order few things.

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,000
He will accurately note it down and deliver it in a nice manner.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,200
While Mohan is accurate in his work, he doesn't provide extra suggestions or recommendation.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:01,040
Madhu on the other hand is also intelligent and accurate, but he provides extra suggestions.

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,440
For example, if a customer is ordering naan and Indian curry and if the weather is cold

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,840
outside, a Madhu will say, why don't you order this hot tomato soup?

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,240
The weather is cold outside and it will really go well with this dish.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,680
If the customer is coming again and again, Madhu will recognize their favorite dish and

22
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,200
they will say, oh, last time you order Hara Bara Kebab, would you like to repeat that?

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,640
So this way Madhu is going one step ahead.

24
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,800
He's an independent thinker.

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,720
He's providing these suggestions and he's autonomous in the way that he works.

26
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,000
The first waiter Mohan on the other hand is not autonomous.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,960
He will do things as directed.

28
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,360
In this analogy, the second waiter Madhu is an AI agent.

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,760
The first waiter Mohan is a traditional AI system.

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
Okay.

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,380
So both are AI system.

32
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,620
The first one is a traditional AI system.

33
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,820
The second one is an AI system, which is based on AI agent.

34
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,760
Here I have the example of a regular chat board where you ask questions such as what

35
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,500
are your store hours?

36
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,620
What pizza options do you have?

37
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,480
You can also place an order.

38
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,880
This kind of chat board can be easily built using frameworks such as dialog flow, Rasa.

39
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,420
There are LLM based frameworks to AI agent based chat board system.

40
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,820
On the other hand, will be autonomous in certain decision making.

41
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:33,800
For example, you're visiting this pizza store Pandeji pizza store every Friday evening and

42
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,600
you're ordering same large veggie pizza with olive topping.

43
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,740
This chat board can learn from it.

44
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,700
And when you say I want to place an order, it can look at your history and say, Hey,

45
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,740
would you like to reorder your usual large pizza?

46
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,980
You'll say yes.

47
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,480
It will also have awareness about environment.

48
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,140
So here it is saying, Hey, it's cold out there.

49
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,000
Do you want to add hot chocolate?

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,980
So all these suggestions that it is providing, they are not coded into your Python program.

51
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,980
This is something that this agent is coming up on its own.

52
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,600
It can also check weather and traffic condition and say, Hey, you want to order a pizza, but

53
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,860
there is a snowstorm and deliveries might be delayed.

54
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,860
This is like human.

55
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,740
If there is a human, he will be aware about environment weather, all of that, and they

56
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,160
will provide extra suggestions.

57
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:32,260
Now let's understand a little more in technical details, how regular AI chat board works.

58
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,460
Whenever you are asking any question, it will first identify an intent.

59
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:42,340
So let's say in my chat board, I have three type of intent, general inquiry, placing order

60
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,340
refund.

61
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:49,880
Based on the question, it will say, Hey, this is a general inquiry intent.

62
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,520
Now you will be like, okay, you can just do exit sentence matching.

63
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,580
And you can say, this is a software program varies AI, but this is an AI based system

64
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,900
because your question might be different instead of saying, what are your store hours?

65
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,760
You can say, Hey, can you tell me when the store is open?

66
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,860
So there is no exit word to word matching.

67
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,980
These two sentences are different, but the meaning is same.

68
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:18,940
So if you're using any LLM, such as GPT, or cloud, etc, it will be able to match all

69
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,600
these sentences, okay?

70
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,660
You can just say that, hey, LLM, if someone asks questions, which is what are your store

71
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:32,300
hours, or a similar question in English language, then the intent is general inquiry.

72
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,700
Once you tell that to LLM, next time, if a person asks questions differently, then also

73
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,300
it will be able to match that intent.

74
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,120
A second question you can ask is, can you place an order with large veggie pizza or

75
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,480
leaven spinach topping, it will match the intent, say place order, not only that it

76
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:57,100
will extract the meaningful information, which is what is my order size, my type toppings,

77
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,100
etc.

78
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,540
And it will call an appropriate code or API or let's say Python function, which you can

79
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,880
run and place the order and insert a record in database and so on.

80
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,920
So this is a traditional chatbot.

81
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,300
This doesn't use any agent, etc.

82
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,240
If you want to learn more in detail, I have this free YouTube video where I build the

83
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,000
exact same chatbot using dialog flow framework.

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,880
Now let's see how AI agent chatbot will work.

85
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:30,480
So first of all, AI agent chatbot will have exact same capabilities as the regular chatbot.

86
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,840
But in addition, it will have extra capabilities.

87
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,920
So when you give a sentence, it will be able to identify the intent, it will extract the

88
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,800
information, call the Python function API and so on.

89
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,080
But in addition, it will have access to something called tools.

90
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,120
Now when I say tools, let's say weather API is one type of tool.

91
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,040
So it will go check weather API and say there is a snowstorm and you know, there is a traffic

92
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,280
deliveries are delayed, then it will give you this kind of response.

93
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,240
It will say, hey, due to snowstorm deliveries might be delayed.

94
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,600
It may have access to another tool such as a database.

95
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,680
Database contains all the past records from the same customer.

96
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,000
Now you can figure out that this customer is ordering same pizza every Friday at 7 p.m.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,120
or evening.

98
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,000
Then you will say, hey, would you like to reorder your usual large pizza with olive

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
toppings?

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,840
So see, this is intelligent and autonomous in your code.

101
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,800
You're not return that when person says place an order, you should give this as a response.

102
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,320
OK, in your code, you have not written that, but the agent figures this thing out on his

103
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,020
own and provides suggestion.

104
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,540
It can have access to web search.

105
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,360
It can have access to a variety of APIs.

106
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,800
So these tools are something that you can define when you are writing code for agent.

107
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:59,920
So agent solution is something for which you have to write code, obviously, but you don't

108
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,220
type all this instruction that if person places an order in a person has a same history

109
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,600
Friday 7 p.m. large veggie, then just repeat that.

110
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,600
OK, you are just providing all these tools, everything.

111
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,960
And this suggestion is something that this agent comes up on its own.

112
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,700
I give an example of an AI chat board, but there are a variety of solutions that can

113
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,440
be a recommendation engine that can be a document search.

114
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,720
You know, you can build a variety of solutions.

115
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,500
Chat board is just one category of AI solutions to summarize.

116
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,880
The main thing in AI agent is autonomy, independent thinking.

117
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,580
Obviously, there will be some limitations on autonomy.

118
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,880
Your chat board cannot say, hey, I will place your order for free and your family and friends.

119
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,720
I will give everything for free.

120
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,160
That kind of autonomy you can't give to the agents.

121
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,520
So when you are building agents by writing code, you will have some kind of control over

122
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
it.

123
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,860
If you cannot control the AI agent will be autonomous.

124
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,680
It's like your dog and you have a lease, right?

125
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,840
So dog can roam around, but you have a lease.

126
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,580
So the area where it can go, that area is limited, right?

127
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:19,840
Let's say you have a two meter long lease or the string, you know, that you tie at dog's

128
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,840
neck.

129
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,140
The dog can roam around in that two meter radius.

130
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,340
So it is autonomous.

131
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,400
But on top of that, there is some control that you're imposing.

132
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,720
There are frameworks such as Langraph, Microsoft autogen, crew AI, etc, that you can use to

133
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,340
build AI agents.

134
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,200
I'm going to be publishing more videos on AI agents in the coming time.

135
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,160
So please keep an eye.

136
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,800
And if you like this video, then please give it a thumbs up, share it with your friends.

137
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,400
