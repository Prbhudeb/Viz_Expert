0	2980	So I think we're going to live in a world where there are going to be hundreds of millions
2980	7800	of billions of different AI agents, eventually probably more AI agents than there are people
7800	8800	in the world.
8800	13440	From generative AI to what's known as agentic AIs.
13440	15960	That agent force is what he's calling it.
15960	16960	Agent force will be...
16960	22600	AI agents has become the talk of the town and today I'm going to explain this concept
22600	26600	in a way that even a high school student can understand it easily.
26600	30600	Let's start with analogy and then we will go into technical details.
30600	35040	Let's say you have a restaurant you hire two waiters, Mohan and Madhu.
35040	36600	Mohan is intelligent and accurate.
36600	41640	He will go to a customer who is coming to a restaurant and then he will offer the food
41640	42640	menu.
42640	44680	The customer will order few things.
44680	49000	He will accurately note it down and deliver it in a nice manner.
49000	55200	While Mohan is accurate in his work, he doesn't provide extra suggestions or recommendation.
55200	61040	Madhu on the other hand is also intelligent and accurate, but he provides extra suggestions.
61040	66440	For example, if a customer is ordering naan and Indian curry and if the weather is cold
66440	71840	outside, a Madhu will say, why don't you order this hot tomato soup?
71840	75240	The weather is cold outside and it will really go well with this dish.
75240	80680	If the customer is coming again and again, Madhu will recognize their favorite dish and
80680	85200	they will say, oh, last time you order Hara Bara Kebab, would you like to repeat that?
85200	88640	So this way Madhu is going one step ahead.
88640	90800	He's an independent thinker.
90800	95720	He's providing these suggestions and he's autonomous in the way that he works.
95720	100000	The first waiter Mohan on the other hand is not autonomous.
100000	101960	He will do things as directed.
101960	107360	In this analogy, the second waiter Madhu is an AI agent.
107360	111760	The first waiter Mohan is a traditional AI system.
111760	112760	Okay.
112760	114380	So both are AI system.
114380	116620	The first one is a traditional AI system.
116620	120820	The second one is an AI system, which is based on AI agent.
120820	125760	Here I have the example of a regular chat board where you ask questions such as what
125760	127500	are your store hours?
127500	129620	What pizza options do you have?
129620	131480	You can also place an order.
131480	136880	This kind of chat board can be easily built using frameworks such as dialog flow, Rasa.
136880	142420	There are LLM based frameworks to AI agent based chat board system.
142420	147820	On the other hand, will be autonomous in certain decision making.
147820	153800	For example, you're visiting this pizza store Pandeji pizza store every Friday evening and
153800	158600	you're ordering same large veggie pizza with olive topping.
158600	160740	This chat board can learn from it.
160740	164700	And when you say I want to place an order, it can look at your history and say, Hey,
164700	168740	would you like to reorder your usual large pizza?
168740	169980	You'll say yes.
169980	172480	It will also have awareness about environment.
172480	175140	So here it is saying, Hey, it's cold out there.
175140	178000	Do you want to add hot chocolate?
178000	184980	So all these suggestions that it is providing, they are not coded into your Python program.
184980	188980	This is something that this agent is coming up on its own.
188980	193600	It can also check weather and traffic condition and say, Hey, you want to order a pizza, but
193600	197860	there is a snowstorm and deliveries might be delayed.
197860	198860	This is like human.
198860	203740	If there is a human, he will be aware about environment weather, all of that, and they
203740	206160	will provide extra suggestions.
206160	212260	Now let's understand a little more in technical details, how regular AI chat board works.
212260	217460	Whenever you are asking any question, it will first identify an intent.
217460	222340	So let's say in my chat board, I have three type of intent, general inquiry, placing order
222340	223340	refund.
223340	229880	Based on the question, it will say, Hey, this is a general inquiry intent.
229880	234520	Now you will be like, okay, you can just do exit sentence matching.
234520	239580	And you can say, this is a software program varies AI, but this is an AI based system
239580	243900	because your question might be different instead of saying, what are your store hours?
243900	246760	You can say, Hey, can you tell me when the store is open?
246760	248860	So there is no exit word to word matching.
248860	251980	These two sentences are different, but the meaning is same.
251980	258940	So if you're using any LLM, such as GPT, or cloud, etc, it will be able to match all
258940	260600	these sentences, okay?
260600	265660	You can just say that, hey, LLM, if someone asks questions, which is what are your store
265660	272300	hours, or a similar question in English language, then the intent is general inquiry.
272300	278700	Once you tell that to LLM, next time, if a person asks questions differently, then also
278700	281300	it will be able to match that intent.
281300	286120	A second question you can ask is, can you place an order with large veggie pizza or
286120	291480	leaven spinach topping, it will match the intent, say place order, not only that it
291480	297100	will extract the meaningful information, which is what is my order size, my type toppings,
297100	298100	etc.
298100	303540	And it will call an appropriate code or API or let's say Python function, which you can
303540	307880	run and place the order and insert a record in database and so on.
307880	309920	So this is a traditional chatbot.
309920	312300	This doesn't use any agent, etc.
312300	317240	If you want to learn more in detail, I have this free YouTube video where I build the
317240	321000	exact same chatbot using dialog flow framework.
321000	323880	Now let's see how AI agent chatbot will work.
323880	330480	So first of all, AI agent chatbot will have exact same capabilities as the regular chatbot.
330480	333840	But in addition, it will have extra capabilities.
333840	337920	So when you give a sentence, it will be able to identify the intent, it will extract the
337920	341800	information, call the Python function API and so on.
341800	347080	But in addition, it will have access to something called tools.
347080	351120	Now when I say tools, let's say weather API is one type of tool.
351120	357040	So it will go check weather API and say there is a snowstorm and you know, there is a traffic
357040	360280	deliveries are delayed, then it will give you this kind of response.
360280	365240	It will say, hey, due to snowstorm deliveries might be delayed.
365240	369600	It may have access to another tool such as a database.
369600	372680	Database contains all the past records from the same customer.
372680	378000	Now you can figure out that this customer is ordering same pizza every Friday at 7 p.m.
378000	379120	or evening.
379120	383000	Then you will say, hey, would you like to reorder your usual large pizza with olive
383000	384000	toppings?
384000	387840	So see, this is intelligent and autonomous in your code.
387840	393800	You're not return that when person says place an order, you should give this as a response.
393800	399320	OK, in your code, you have not written that, but the agent figures this thing out on his
399320	402020	own and provides suggestion.
402020	404540	It can have access to web search.
404540	407360	It can have access to a variety of APIs.
407360	413800	So these tools are something that you can define when you are writing code for agent.
413800	419920	So agent solution is something for which you have to write code, obviously, but you don't
419920	425220	type all this instruction that if person places an order in a person has a same history
425220	428600	Friday 7 p.m. large veggie, then just repeat that.
428600	431600	OK, you are just providing all these tools, everything.
431600	436960	And this suggestion is something that this agent comes up on its own.
436960	442700	I give an example of an AI chat board, but there are a variety of solutions that can
442700	446440	be a recommendation engine that can be a document search.
446440	449720	You know, you can build a variety of solutions.
449720	454500	Chat board is just one category of AI solutions to summarize.
454500	459880	The main thing in AI agent is autonomy, independent thinking.
459880	463580	Obviously, there will be some limitations on autonomy.
463580	467880	Your chat board cannot say, hey, I will place your order for free and your family and friends.
467880	469720	I will give everything for free.
469720	473160	That kind of autonomy you can't give to the agents.
473160	478520	So when you are building agents by writing code, you will have some kind of control over
478520	479520	it.
479520	483860	If you cannot control the AI agent will be autonomous.
483860	486680	It's like your dog and you have a lease, right?
486680	489840	So dog can roam around, but you have a lease.
489840	493580	So the area where it can go, that area is limited, right?
493580	499840	Let's say you have a two meter long lease or the string, you know, that you tie at dog's
499840	500840	neck.
500840	503140	The dog can roam around in that two meter radius.
503140	504340	So it is autonomous.
504340	508400	But on top of that, there is some control that you're imposing.
508400	514720	There are frameworks such as Langraph, Microsoft autogen, crew AI, etc, that you can use to
514720	516340	build AI agents.
516340	520200	I'm going to be publishing more videos on AI agents in the coming time.
520200	522160	So please keep an eye.
522160	525800	And if you like this video, then please give it a thumbs up, share it with your friends.
